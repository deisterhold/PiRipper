# Pi Ripper
Raspberry Pi based DVD Ripper utilizing BalenaOS.

## Overview
This is a project that I started to rip all the DVD's that I own. It is currently WIP and I am hoping that MakeMKV will be available for ARM devices soon.

# To Do
- Get script working successfully
- Provide a browser UI for showing the status
- Remote transcoding support (Handbrake is quite slow on the Pi)
- NAS Support

## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi
- USB DVD Drive
- USB HDD (Optional)
